# Calculator

This is a command line calculator. It was my first year course project at university. Presented here "as-is."

**Features**:
- Has no limitation on the complexity of the expression and the length of the input string.
- Supports:
  - scientific (exponential) notation of numbers
  - standard operations +, -, *, /, ^
  - functions sqrt, sin, cos, tg (tangent in Russian notation), ctg, arcsin, arccos, arctg, ln, log
  - constants pi and e
  - saving the result within one string, for example, input "x = 2 * 2; y = 1 + 2; x^y + x" yields 68.
